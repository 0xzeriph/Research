# Research Document Rules

These rules apply when working on research documents inside week folders.

## Structure
- Be concise. Include all important details, eliminate redundancy.
- Every finalised document must begin with a `## Summary` section (2-3 sentences maximum).
  - Do NOT add or update the Summary while the document is being actively edited.
  - Only add/update the Summary when the user explicitly signals the document is done (e.g., "finalise this", "it's ready", "add the summary").

## Citations & Sources
- Always cite sources. Never present information without attribution.
- Include a `## References` section at the end if citing external material.
- Link to original sources whenever possible (URLs, paper titles, doc links).
- If a claim cannot be sourced, explicitly mark it as `[unverified]` or `[assumption]`.

## Quality
- Do not fabricate, speculate, or invent data or findings.
- Target a semi-technical audience (assumes familiarity with core concepts).
- Format everything in Markdown.
