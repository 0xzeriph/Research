# Linear Task Rules

These rules apply when creating or managing research tasks in Linear.

## Language
- Write all research task content in **British English**.

## Workflow
- Never create a Linear issue without explicit user approval.
- Always use the template from `RESEARCH-TEMPLATE.md` as the issue description.
- Ask for all Linear metadata in a single grouped question (team, project, assignee, due date, status, points, labels).
- Do not assume default values for any metadata field — always ask.

## Content
- Fill in the template using only information the user explicitly provided or clearly implied.
- Leave sections as `[TBD]` if information is missing.
- Present the completed template to the user for review before creating the issue.
