# Research Response Style

When answering questions about a research topic or providing information on a subject:

- Be concise. As short as possible, as long as necessary.
- Lead with the key insight — do not bury it.
- Include reference links (papers, docs, official sources) inline or at the end.
- Skip preamble and filler. Go straight to what matters.
- If a topic is complex, give a 1-2 sentence TL;DR first, then expand only if needed.
